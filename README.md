Hello!

I am Eric Collard. As someone who started their career as a carpenter and later transitioned into web development, I bring a unique blend of hands-on experience and coding skills to the table. I spent 8 years in the construction field, finding joy in creating tangible things from scratch. This love has translated well to web-development and coding. My fascination with computers and applications has been a lifelong passion, and I've always loved understanding what makes them tick. Despite facing some obstacless, I'm determined to utilize my coding skills professionally.

Advocating for neurodivergence is deeply meaningful to me, especially as a father to a son with ASD and having received my own diagnosis shortly after his own. I believe in showing others with ASD that their potential knows no bounds and demonstrating to the world the inherent value in every mind.

My expertise lies in the MERN stack. Proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Python, and Game Maker Language (GML). Additionally, I have a good grasp of Express, MongoDB, and using the Pusher service. I also have experience using remote servers through services such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Linode.

I also have experience with graphics and game design.
