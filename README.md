Hello!

I am Eric Collard, a student currently enrolled in Commonwealth Coders, a program in the Lincoln Trail district of Kentucky developed to help people learn and implement coding skills.

I have some experience with HTML, CSS and GML, and learning how to use languages such as HTML, Python and Java among others.

I also have experience with graphics and game design and am currently working on developing a small video-game.

Additional info will be added.
